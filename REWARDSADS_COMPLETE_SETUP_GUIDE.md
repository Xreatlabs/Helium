## üéì SECTION 12: UNDERSTANDING THE FLOW

To help you understand how everything connects:

```
User Journey:
1. User clicks "Complete RewardsAds" on Helium dashboard
   ‚Üì
2. Helium creates one-time token for security
   ‚Üì
3. User redirected to: /rewardsads/start?user_id=XXX&token=YYY
   ‚Üì
4. Helium page loads RewardsAds SDK from: https://sdk.rewardsx.net/rewardads.js
   ‚Üì
5. SDK initializes with your Platform ID and Secret Key
   ‚Üì
6. SDK contacts RewardsX servers to:
   - Verify platform is active ‚Üê ERROR HAPPENS HERE IF NOT VERIFIED
   - Check domain is authorized
   - Fetch available offers
   - Display offer to user
   ‚Üì
7. User completes offer
   ‚Üì
8. RewardsX SDK calls onSuccess callback
   ‚Üì
9. User redirected back to: /rewardsads/callback
   ‚Üì
10. Helium validates token and awards coins
```

**The Error Point:**
Step 6 is where "you can't buy for your platform" occurs. This means RewardsX SDK is blocking the transaction because your platform is not fully verified/activated on their end.
